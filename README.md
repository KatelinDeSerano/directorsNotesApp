# Director's Notes App

App for taking and distributing production notes. 

Summary: I have participated in many theatre productions as an actor and a stage manager,  
and after a full rehearsal run of the show, the cast and crew still need to stick around to receive notes 
on how the dress rehearsal went. 

This whole process could take another hour, when everyone is ready to go home. This Director's Notes App allows directors to 
distribute their notes to their actors instantly,  so their cast and crew can go home,  get some rest,  and be ready 
to come to rehearsal the next day and nail it. 

How it works:  

Users can sign up and log in as an Actor OR a Director.
